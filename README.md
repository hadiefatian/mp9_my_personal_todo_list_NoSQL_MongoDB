# Mp9 - My Personal ToDo List (NoSQL MongoDB)
The ToDo application has an endpoint /todos where we can post our ToDo objects. A ToDo object contains the id,  one string representing our tasks for us to do later and a boolean that says whether it is done or not. We can always see them if you make a get request to /todos. In order to see a particular ToDo we will do a get request to /todos/{id}. And if we want to mark a ToDo as done we will post to /todos/{id}/done. This application will connect to a MongoDB in a local environment or also in a hosted instance in the cloud with a given username and password.
